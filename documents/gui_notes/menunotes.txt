Potential settings:
    - Replay speed
    - Acceleration scaling
    - No setting for the action mode: One button for shaking, one for importing data
    - Save/load replay?
    - robustness of the beams

buttons:
    - start
    - pause?
    - stop
    - replay
    - reset
    - load earthquake data
    - load beam model

Editing interface:
    - Generally: Structures don't move until the simulation is started, even if they aren't stable
    - Would a contextual action mode work for editing?
    - Button/selectable item for adding a beam. In each case, the starting and end point snaps to
        existing vertices. Options:
        - (easier, but uglier) Prompt to touch the starting point, then prompt to touch the endpoint
        - (harder, but nicer) Touch the starting point; a beam appears which can be dragged until it
            reaches the desired length and orientation
    - Button/selectable item for deleting beams
